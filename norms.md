## Class Norms: 

**Environment: Consider where you learn best**

_Think about how you learn best:_

* Do you like noise or silence?

* Does movement distract you, or does it help you focus on the task at hand?

* Learning takes attention, and be sure that your full attention is focused on your class when you are there.


**Video Practices: How you can most effectively participate in class.**

* Always keeping your video on and your microphone muted is a great way to feel present in a group without disrupting the experience for your peers.

* If you would like to chime in or ask a question, you can (and should!) come off mic!

* If you need to step away from your computer for a few minutes, or you are eating a delicious bowl of salad, direct message your instructor and turn your video off. Don’t forget to come back!


**Professionalism: Maintain a professional demeanor**

* Think about the last time you were in a classroom environment - how did you interact with your peers?

* Learning in your own space is very comfortable, and at times, it is easy to forget that you are on camera and in class!

* The same classroom norms apply: speak to each other respectfully, avoiding profanity. Be sure your attire is appropriate for a classroom setting, and the location you are in does not have any images or paraphernalia that others may find disrespectful.

**Community: Participate - We learn through doing!**

* Come off mic to ask questions, actively engage in the breakout rooms - we learn through doing!

* This is what sets our online classroom apart from similar institutions - it is an interactive experience.


**Respect** – Present problems in a way that promotes mutual discussion and resolution. Treat others with the same level of respect you would like to receive in return.

**Genuine** - Be genuine with each other and your instructors about ideas, challenges, and feelings.

**Open-mind** - Practice being open-minded in your interaction with others.

**Patience** -  Be patient with yourself, the process, and with others when working together.

**Willingness to Learn** - Working with people from other backgrounds exposes you to customs, cultures and practices you might never experienced before. A willingness to get to know your classmates on a personal level will create a sense of goodwill in the classroom that can translate to better collaboration.
